## Introduction
Hello, this week's code challenge has three parts that are going to test what we have learnt in JavaScript so far.

## Descriptions

### i. Student Grade Calculator
This challenge was testing on a code which accepts a score as an input and outputs the appropriate grade. The function in the code  checks if the score is larger than 79, returning an A grade; if the score is between 60 and 79, returning a B grade; and so on, using an if-else statement. After that, the function returns the grade and assigns it to a variable named grade. Lastly, the function sets the innerHTML of an element with the id "return" to "Grade: " followed by the grade variable value using document.getElementById.

### ii. Speed Detector Challenge

This challeng requires a code that performs the task of determining if a particular speed is permitted or not. This is accomplished by comparing the specified speed to the range of 0 to 70. The function returns "Ok" if the speed entered is within this range. If not, it divides the difference between the specified speed and 70 by 5 and rounds down to determine the amount of demerit points.

Next, the function in the code determines if there are more demerit points than 12. The function returns "License suspended" if such is the case. If not, a string with the total amount of demerit points is returned.

### iii. Net Salary Calculator

This challenge requireds a code program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
